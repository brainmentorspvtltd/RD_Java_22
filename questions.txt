Binary Tree
- which contains 0,1 or 2 children

Tree Traversal is classified into 2 categories
1. Breadth First / Level Order - use queue to implement this
2. Depth First - use stack to implement this
    - InOrder - LPR (Left Parent Right)
    - PreOrder - PLR (Parent Left Right)
    - PostOrder - LRP (Left Right Parent)

1. Recursion
2. Iterative
